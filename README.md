# ePub to MDBook

I consider myself as a "book hacker". I love to read on different formats and media, and something I catch myself exploring new typografies and layouts for my books. Generally speaking I prefer to read on my Kindle, but technical books tend to be an exception as they contain more complex structures and images that are not well rendered on e-ink screens.

At the same time, I was felt like there was a gap between the simplicity of current standards we see on Markdown-related documentation tools and the complexity of ePub. One great example is mdBook, a tool that allows you to create beautiful documentation websites and/or books from Markdown files. I'd like to have an opportunity to read my technical books through this format instead of the traditional ePub.

So, that's why I decided to create this project. I want to create a tool that can convert an ePub file to a mdBook project. This way, I can read my technical books on a beautiful website, with a great layout and typography, and still have the ability to navigate through the chapters and sections. I also plan to incorporate new features and provide better support.

I hope you enjoy!
